# documentation

This repository is a temporary location for the public Aurelia documentation. We hope to launch a more robust solution in the near future, but in the mean time, feel free to contribute fixes, additional documentation and new translations here. Please see [our contributing guidelines](https://github.com/DurandalProject/about/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information about that process.
